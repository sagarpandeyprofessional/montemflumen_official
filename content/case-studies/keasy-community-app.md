challenge: "Foreigners living in South Korea rely on scattered chats, posts, and word-of-mouth to find trustworthy information and community. Discovering the right KakaoTalk groups, practical life guides, events, and job opportunities is time-consuming—and local businesses and organizers struggle to reach foreign residents directly. Keasy needed a single, easy hub that organizes everything and makes it searchable, trustworthy, and mobile-friendly."
outcome: "We created Keasy as an English-first community app with clear navigation and purpose-built sections—Home, Events, Community, Guides, Connect, and Jobs. Users can discover and join community chat groups across multiple platforms, explore practical guides written by the community, and find jobs from local businesses."

## The Challenge

Living in Korea as a foreigner often means juggling multiple apps and communities just to get basic things done—finding the right chat groups, learning how phone verification works, discovering local services, and keeping up with events and opportunities.

Most resources were fragmented:
- Community groups were hard to discover unless you already knew someone
- Helpful information was buried in chats and repeated endlessly
- Events and job posts lived in separate places with inconsistent formats
- Local businesses and organizers had no direct, structured channel to reach foreigners

Keasy needed a single hub that feels simple and welcoming—while still being powerful enough to organize a lot of community-driven content.

## Our Approach

We designed Keasy around one core idea: **make life in Korea easier through structured community knowledge**.

That meant:
1. Creating a clear information architecture (Home → Events → Community → Guides → Connect → Jobs)
2. Designing “content types” with predictable layouts (community groups, guides, job posts)
3. Making discovery effortless with categories, search, filters, and consistent metadata
4. Keeping everything mobile-first, fast, and easy to contribute to

## The Solution

### Community: “New Community Group” Directory
We built a directory where foreigners can discover and join community groups across platforms (KakaoTalk, WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram). Each group includes:
- Category tags (General, Professional, Language, Hobbies, Food, etc.)
- A short description that sets expectations
- Member counts and platform label
- One-click “Join Group” links

This transforms “hidden networks” into a discoverable ecosystem.

### Guides: Practical, Searchable Knowledge
We designed Guides as a structured knowledge base written by Keasy and the community. Features include:
- Category browsing (Transportation, Banking & Finance, Shopping, Documents, Jobs, etc.)
- Search by title/description
- Views/likes to surface what’s working
- “Create Guide” flow so the community can contribute

The result is content that feels easy to find, save, share, and trust.

### Events: A Central Place to Stay Connected
Events help foreigners move from online community to real-world connection. We structured Events as a dedicated section with consistent listing formats so users can quickly understand:
- What’s happening
- When and where
- How to join

### Connect: Making New Relationships Easier
We designed Connect as a lightweight way to help foreigners meet others—reducing friction for newcomers who don’t yet have community links or local networks.

### Jobs: Opportunities from Local Businesses
Jobs were designed to support both sides:
- Foreigners can browse opportunities by category and search keywords
- Businesses can register and post roles with clear structure (location, type, salary, deadline, languages, skills)

This created a direct channel for local businesses to reach foreign customers and talent through Keasy.

### Consistent Navigation & Trust Signals
Across the platform, we emphasized:
- Clear top navigation (Home, Events, Community, Guides, Connect, Jobs)
- Consistent layouts and metadata (author, category, counts)
- Scalable structure for moderation, expansion, and future features

## Results

The MVP delivered a usable, real community hub with early traction signals:
- **32+ guides** published with strong engagement (top guides reaching **1.1K+ views**)
- Community group directory featuring active groups across platforms (including groups with **3,000+ members**)
- Live jobs module with structured postings and company registration
- A single destination where foreigners can discover resources, community, and opportunities without hopping between apps

## Lessons Learned

1. **Structure beats noise**: turning chat knowledge into searchable guides dramatically increases usefulness.
2. **Cross-platform community is real**: people gather on different apps—Keasy’s job is to unify discovery.
3. **Two-sided value matters**: when local businesses can reach foreigners directly, the ecosystem grows faster.
