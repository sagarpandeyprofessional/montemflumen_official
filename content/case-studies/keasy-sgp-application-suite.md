challenge: "International students applying to Woosong University’s Sol Green Police (SGP) program face a high-friction process: Korean-only forms, strict formatting, and uncertainty about what interviewers expect. Students were wasting time rewriting documents, making avoidable mistakes, and relying on scattered advice. Keasy needed a structured, English-friendly support flow that still produces Korean-ready outputs."
outcome: "We delivered an end-to-end SGP application experience: a step-by-step resume/self-introduction form that generates a clean printable PDF, plus an online direct-apply page for submission. To improve success rates, we also created a detailed interview guide with the exact interview structure, key expectations, and example answers in Korean and English."

## The Challenge

Sol Green Police (SGP) is a structured work–scholarship program with strict expectations—and international students often struggle to navigate the application process.

The pain points were consistent:
- Korean-only, form-heavy documents that are easy to fill incorrectly
- A confusing workflow (print requirements, formatting, submission steps)
- Interview uncertainty: students didn’t know what matters most or how to answer
- Repetitive questions across student communities with inconsistent advice

Keasy needed to reduce friction and increase clarity—without changing the official requirements.

## Our Approach

We designed the experience around one goal: **make the SGP process simple, structured, and repeatable**.

That meant:
1. Turning official-style forms into a guided, step-by-step UI
2. Ensuring outputs match real-world submission needs (print + PDF)
3. Adding an “online direct apply” route so students can submit confidently
4. Creating a practical interview guide that reflects the actual interview format

## The Solution

### Resume Filler: Guided Form for SGP Submission
We built a complete resume/self-introduction form flow that mirrors the structure students must submit, while making it much easier to complete.

Key features:
- Clearly separated sections (personal info, education, experience, skills)
- Required-field handling so students don’t miss critical items
- A layout designed to match real submission expectations

### Print + PDF Download
Students needed a submission-ready artifact, not just an on-screen form.
We added:
- **Print mode** for clean paper output
- **PDF download** for saving/sharing and re-printing later

This eliminated rewriting, formatting issues, and repeated manual edits.

### Online Direct Apply
We implemented an online direct application path so students can:
- Complete the application in one flow
- Submit with confidence and fewer mistakes
- Reduce back-and-forth confusion about “what to do next”

### Interview Preparation Guide (SGP)
To increase success rates, we created a comprehensive guide that covers:
- The non-negotiable expectations (attendance, behavior, punctuality)
- The three core interview questions that matter most
- What recruiters look for and how to structure answers
- Example answers line-by-line in **Korean + English**
- Practical interview-day rules (arrival time, attire, waiting behavior)

The guide is designed for international students: clear, direct, and realistic.

## Results

- A complete SGP application workflow: **Fill → Print/PDF → Apply**
- Reduced friction for international students completing Korean-style documents
- Clearer interview preparation through structured guidance and examples
- A scalable pattern Keasy can reuse for other student programs and applications

## Beyond the Numbers

This project turned a stressful, unclear process into something students can complete with confidence.
Instead of relying on scattered chat advice or trial-and-error, students now have:
- A reliable tool to produce submission-ready documents
- A straightforward path to apply
- A guide that explains what actually matters in the interview

It’s a practical example of Keasy’s mission: making life in Korea easier through community-first tools.
