## The Challenge

Keasy set out to build a marketplace that actually works for people living in Korea who don’t speak Korean fluently—especially foreigners looking to buy and sell goods without friction.

Most options were either fragmented (spread across communities) or difficult to use due to language barriers, inconsistent listing quality, and unclear buyer/seller expectations. At the same time, local businesses had limited ways to reach foreign customers directly.

Keasy needed a single marketplace where:
- Foreigners can browse, list, and transact in English
- Local businesses can showcase products and reach foreign customers directly
- The experience feels trustworthy, clear, and mobile-friendly

## Our Approach

We approached Keasy as a two-sided product from the start—designing for both buyers and sellers (foreign individuals and local stores).

Our process focused on:
1. Defining a realistic MVP scope that enables real marketplace activity
2. Designing simple, familiar marketplace flows (browse → search → detail → action)
3. Building a scalable foundation so search and analytics can improve over time

## The Solution

### English-first Marketplace UX
We designed an interface optimized for foreigners in Korea: clear navigation, simple CTAs, and predictable commerce patterns so users can move from discovery to action confidently.

### Buyer and Seller Flows
We created user journeys that support:
- Individual sellers posting goods quickly
- Buyers discovering items easily and understanding what to do next
- Local businesses listing products to reach foreigners directly

### Search and Discovery
Marketplace success depends on discovery, so we prioritized structure that can grow into richer filtering, sorting, and ranking as inventory expands.

### Seller Tooling and Analytics
To make the platform valuable for local businesses, we included seller-oriented tooling and laid the groundwork for performance insights—helping sellers understand demand and optimize listings over time.

### Scalable MVP Architecture
We implemented a modern, scalable setup so the marketplace can grow in categories, traffic, and features without needing a full rebuild.

## Results

- Launched a live marketplace experience within the Keasy ecosystem
- Enabled English-first access for foreigners living in Korea
- Created a direct channel for local businesses to reach foreign customers
- Built a foundation ready for iterative improvements to search, analytics, and category expansion

## Beyond the Numbers

Keasy Marketplace is more than a buying and selling tool—it’s a bridge between communities.

Foreign residents get an experience that feels usable and trustworthy in English, while local businesses gain new visibility with customers they typically struggle to reach. As the marketplace grows, Keasy becomes a stronger hub for practical life in Korea—powered by community commerce.
